# Kiota Azure Library for Dart

[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/microsoft_kiota_azure?logo=dart&label=Latest)](https://pub.dev/packages/microsoft_kiota_azure)

The Kiota Azure Library for Dart is an Azure authentication provider implementation for the [`microsoft_kiota_abstractions`](https://pub.dev/packages/microsoft_kiota_abstractions) package.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to an authentication to make authenticated requests to an API endpoint that uses Azure.

Read more about Kiota [here](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md).

dart pub add microsoft_kiota_azure
